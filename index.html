            Blackjack is a game that involves 2 players. The dealer deals 2
            cards to himself and the player at the start of the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal is to get to 21 points. The winner is the person who is
            closest to 21 points. If both players go over 21 points, they both
            lose.
          </p>
          <p>
            If one person goes over 21 and the other person is under 21, the
            person under 21 points wins.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jack/Queen/King counts as 10 points. Ace counts as 1 or 11 points
            depending on the player.
          </p>
          <p>
            The player must decide if they want to hit(gain an additional card)
            or stand(don't want an additional card to boost their points).
