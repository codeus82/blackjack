        Blackjack is a game that involves 2 players. The dealer deals 2 cards to
        himself and the player at the start of the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal is to get to 21 points. The winner is the person who is closest
        to 21 points. If both players go over 21 points, they both lose.
      </p>
      <p>
        If one person goes over 21 and the other person is under 21, the person
        under 21 points wins.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jack/Queen/King counts as 10 points. Ace counts as 1 or 11 points
        depending on the player.
      </p>
      <p>
        The player must decide if they want to hit(gain an additional card) or
        stand(don't want an additional card to boost their points).
      </p>
